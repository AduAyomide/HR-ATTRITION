Presenting My First Dashboard: Insights on Employee Attrition

Thrilled to share my first self-created dashboard: Employee Attrition Analysis! This project was a rewarding challenge, allowing me to apply my growing skills in data visualization.

The dashboard offers key insights into employee attrition, helping organizations understand workforce trends. This encourages proactive steps and facilitates creation of employee retention strategies.

Key Insights:

1. Summary Key Performance Indicators
Total Employees: 1,470
Exited Employees: 237 (16.12% attrition rate)
A quick glance reveals critical workforce stability metrics.

2. Attrition by Gender:
Exited Employees, as shown below:
Male - 150
Female - 87
This helps identify gender-specific attrition patterns.

3. Impact of Age on Employee Retention:
A histogram identifies age groups most at risk for attrition, enabling targeted retention strategies.

This project taught me the importance of data storytellingâ€”connecting numbers to actionable insights. An instance of this could be tailoring retention programs for specific demographics.

I further developed my technical skills with the aid of Microsoft Excel (focused on Pivot Tables and Charts) to design an intuitive and effective dashboard, ensuring each element supports decision-making.
